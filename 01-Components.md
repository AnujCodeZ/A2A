# Components
## A2A Client 
- An application or agent that consumes A2A services.
- It sends requests (like `tasks/send`) to an A2A Server's URL.

## A2A Server
- Exposes an Standard HTTP endpoint.
- Recieves request and manages task execution.

### Agent Card
- Each A2A Server has a metadata file, usually presents at `/.well-known/agent.json` for each Agent.
- Clients use this for discovery.
- It contains the following information:
    - Agent capabilities
    - Agent Skills
    - Endpoint URL
    - Authentication

## Task
- A central unit of work.
- A client initiates a task by sending a message (`tasks/send` or `tasks/sendSubscribe`)
- It has the following status:
    - submitted
    - working
    - input-required
    - completed
    - failed
    - canceled
- Each task has an unique ID.
- The message consists of fundamental content unit called Part.
- Type of Parts:
    - TextPart
    - FilePart (inline bytes or URI)
    - DataPart (for structured JSON)

## Artifact
- Represents outputs generated by the agent during a task.
- Artifacts also consists of Part

## Processes
### Streaming
- For long-running tasks, Server supporting streaming capabilities can use `tasks/sendSubscribe`.
- The client recieves Server-Send Events (SSE) containing TasksStatusUpdateEvent or TaskArtifactUpdateEvent messages, providing real-time progress.

### Push Notification
- Server supporting pushNotifications can proactively send task updates to the client provided webhook URL.
- Configured via `tasks/pushNotification/set`

### Non-Streaming
- Final result can be send directly to client with same task by a status.
